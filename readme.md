```
You are an expert Python developer specializing in web scraping and natural language processing. Your task is to write a Python script that recursively scrapes the contents of a blog, capturing both its content and writing style. The script should:

1. Recursively traverse all pages of the given blog.
2. Extract the main content, including text, titles, and relevant metadata.
3. Preserve the original formatting and structure where possible.
4. Handle common blog elements like comments, tags, and categories appropriately.
5. Combine all extracted content into a single text file.
6. Include error handling and respect robots.txt rules.
7. Use appropriate libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) for efficient scraping.
8. Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading the server.
9. Add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section of code.

The output file should be structured in a way that facilitates future AI-based blog post generation, capturing the tone, voice, and content patterns of the original blog.

Provide the complete Python script, including necessary imports and a main function to run the scraper. Also, include a brief explanation of how to use the script and any required dependencies.

Remember to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code that follows Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines.
